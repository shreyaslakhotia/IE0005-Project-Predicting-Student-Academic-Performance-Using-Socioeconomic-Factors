# Predicting Student Academic Performance Using Socioeconomic Factors


## Predicting Student Academic Performance Using Socioeconomic Factors


### Overview

Welcome to our Data Science project repository! This project focuses on predicting student academic performance based on socioeconomic factors using various machine learning models. We have utilized a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, and our goal is to understand the impact of these factors on students' academic outcomes and identify the most influential predictors.


### Project Highlights

#### Dataset
We have selected a dataset from Kaggle containing the following columns:

gender

race_ethnicity

parental_level_of_education

lunch

test_preparation_course

math_score

reading_score

writing_score


#### Problem Statement

The core of our project revolves around examining whether socioeconomic factors such as parental education level, lunch status, and test preparation courses can predict a student's academic performance category. The performance categories are defined as follows based on their total scores:

Fail

Third Division

Second Division

First Division


#### Objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigate the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.

2. Feature Engineering: Create new features and preprocess data for model training.

3. Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict academic performance categories. Models include:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

XGBoost

Support Vector Machine

4. Comparative Analysis: Identify the most influential factors by comparing the performance of different models.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide insights into the underlying socioeconomic disparities impacting academic outcomes and propose targeted interventions to support student success.
